# CamStudy Optimization Summary (Presentation Notes)

## Quick Overview - Key Optimizations

### 1. **Memory Management**
- Proper resource cleanup (Camera, TensorFlow model, TTS engine)
- Direct ByteBuffer allocation for image processing
- Efficient bitmap scaling to 640x640

### 2. **Performance**
- Background threading for AI inference and API calls
- Session persistence with SharedPreferences
- Camera operations via ExecutorService

### 3. **AI Model (YOLOv5)**
- Memory-mapped model loading
- Optimized preprocessing pipeline
- Confidence-based filtering
- TensorFlow Lite for mobile efficiency

### 4. **User Experience**
- Responsive UI with loading indicators
- Asynchronous operations
- Cached preferences (flash, language)
- Graceful error handling

### 5. **Battery Life**
- Resources released when not in use
- Efficient camera lifecycle management
- Minimal background processing

---

**Result**: Smooth performance on mid-range Android devices with real-time object detection and translation.
